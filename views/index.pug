            li I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a Unix timestamp (e.g., 1495158122) or a natural language date (e.g., May 19, 2017).

            li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
            li If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
